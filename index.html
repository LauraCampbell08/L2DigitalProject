        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>Showquest is the biggest performing arts contest in Aotearoa. It is often described as an innovative and vibrant youth competition solely based on student talent and their creations. The journey of Showquest Aotearoa began in the early 2010s, originally known as “Stage Challenge”, later rebranded to Showquest in 2019. This event's initial focus was on dance choreography, routines, formations, and differing themes.<br>
            The primary aim was to captivate the audience and win over the judges with unique, moving storytelling performances. Over the years, Showquest has gained popularity, attracting diverse students and performers from all over the country and gradually expanding to explore a broader range of performing arts, including drama, singing, instrumental music, filmmaking, and more.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Within a few years of production, in 2019, the competition underwent “a transformative rebranding” to revitalize its identity and reflect a more inclusive approach, highlighting the integration of multiple art forms. Showquest Aotearoa now embraces themes of cultural diversity and social issues, encouraging participants to think deeply about performing thought-provoking pieces. With its new name and enhanced mission, this competition continues to provide an amazing platform for artistic expression. Over the years, Showquest Aotearoa has evolved massively and has become a celebration of New Zealand's cultural heritage while encouraging the next generation of performers, creators, and critical thinkers.</p>

        <h2>2023 Kuranui Showquest</h2>
        <h3>Placing: 3rd place</h3>
        <p>"On November 1st, 1944, 733 Polish children arrived in Pahiatua to seek refuge along with 105 caregivers. Ripped from their families, they had survived deportation to the Soviet Union, forced labor in Siberia, evacuation to the Middle East, and a tremendous amount of loss and sorrow. A camp, dubbed “Little Poland,” was established for the refugees; many of them never saw their families again. Most Kiwis have never heard the story of the 733 Polish children, and Kuranui College wishes to share the harrowing journey the children endured and the pain and loss their families experienced."</p>

        <h3>Placing: 1st place</h3>
        <p>"In December 1942, ward 5 of the Seacliff Lunatic Asylum caught fire. The female patients, labeled as ‘difficult women,’ were locked in. By the time the guards arrived, it was too late; only two women survived. The asylum had a history of patient mistreatment and there was little help or understanding of mental illness. Mental health issues, particularly among women and youth, have soared during the coronavirus pandemic. Quarantine, hardship, and uncertainty have taken a significant psychological toll. 2020 marked the 80th anniversary of the Seacliff fire, and we want to remember those women and spread awareness of mental health."</p>

        <h3>Placing: 1st place</h3>
        <p>"Over New Year 2021, male prisoners at Waikeria Prison rioted. Dissatisfied with their inhumane and unhygienic living conditions and lack of access to rehabilitative education and tikanga Māori, they lit fires and stayed on the roof for six days to draw attention to their demands for basic human rights. Rather than resolving the issues, the “top jail” was destroyed in the fire, and the prisoners were sent to a different prison. All people, even criminals, deserve humane treatment and should not have to fight for basic human rights."</p>

        <h3>Placing: 1st place</h3>
        <p>"This year, Kuranui’s theme was based on the historical dispute over Lake Wairarapa. Originally, the lake had abundant fish life, which was important for providing kai to the many Māori who lived around its shores. Mid-last century, a scheme to eliminate regular flooding and establish more farmland saw the Ruamahanga River, which flowed through the lake, diverted. The local Māori lost a court battle to stop the scheme. Without fresh water, the lake became stagnant, and the once bountiful lake became lifeless."</p>

        <h2>2018 Kuranui Showquest</h2>
        <h3>Placing: 1st place</h3>
        <p>"Nga wairua o te ope taua o te ao, The spirits of the forgotten battalion, Te mura o te ahi. The flame of the fire. Our story is about a mother who endures her father’s experiences as a soldier in the Māori battalion during World War II. An emotional journey for both her and her son as she is reluctant to show him what war really is. We tell the tale without glorifying war and pay tribute to those forgotten in the war, the Māori Battalion, and those soldiers who lived through the war and had to live their lives without their comrades. If we don’t tell their story… no one will."</p>

        <p>On April 10, 1968, the passenger ferry ‘Wahine’ was caught in a fierce storm stirred by Cyclone Giselle. The boat ran aground on the rocks of Barret Reef at the entrance to Wellington Harbour, sustaining irreparable damage and causing the abandonment of the ship. Of the 734 people aboard, 51 died immediately; two more died weeks later due to sustained injuries. Through our performance, we trace the tragedy through the eyes of a local family, retelling a story that many Kiwis remember.</p>
