	<h2> Information</h2>
	<p>Showquest is the biggest performing arts contest in Aotearoa. It is often described as an innovative and vibrant youth competition solely based on student talent and their creations. The journey of Showquest Aotearoa began in the early 2010s being originally known as “Stage Challenge”, later being rebranded to Showquest (2019). This event's initial focus was on dance choreography, routines, formations and differing themes.<br>
    The primary aim was to captivate the audience and win over the judges with your unique moving storytelling performance. Over the years Showquest has gained popularity, attracting diverse students and performers from all over the country, and has gradually expanded to explore a broader range of performing arts throughout performances including drama, singing, intrumental, film making and  more. </p>

				<h2> History </h2>
<p>Within a few years of production, in 2019, the competition underwent “a transformative rebranding”, which was said to revitalize identity and reflect more of an inclusive approach, highlighting the integration of multiple art forms. 
Showquest Aotearoa is now known to embrace themes of cultural diversity and social issues through encouraging participants to think thoroughly about performing a thought-provoking piece. With its new name and enhanced mission, this competition continues to provide an amazing platform for artistic expression. Over the years, ShowQuest Aotearoa has evolved massively and has become a celebration of New Zealand's cultural heritage, while also encouraging the next generation of performers, creators and critical thinkers.

<h2> 2023 Kuranui Showquest </h2>		
<h3> Placing: 3rd place </h3>
		"On November 1st 1944, 733 Polish children arrived in Pahiatua to seek refuge along with 105 caregivers. Ripped from their families, they had survived deportation to the Soviet Union, forced labour in Siberia, evacuation to the Middle East and a ton of loss and sorrow. A camp, dubbed “Little Poland” was established for the refugees, many of them never saw their families again. Most kiwis have never heard the story of the 733 Polish children and Kuranui College wishes to share the harrowing journey the children had to take and the pain and loss that their families endured".

	<h3> Placing: 1st place </h3>
	     "In December, 1942, ward 5 of the Seacliff Lunatic Asylum caught fire. The female patients, labelled as ‘difficult women’, were locked in. By the time the guards arrived, it was too late; only two women survived.
         The asylum had a history of patient mistreatment and there was little help or understanding of mental illness. 
         Mental health issues, particularly among women and youth, have soared during the coronavirus pandemic. Quarantine, hardship and uncertainty have taken a significant psychological toll. 2020 is the 80th anniversary of the Seacliff fire, and we want to remember those women and spread awareness of mental health".

	<h2> 2021 Kuranui Showquest </h2>
	<h3> Placing: 1st place </h3>
       	"Over New Year, 2021, male prisoners at Waikeria Prison rioted. Dissatisfied with their inhumane and unhygienic living conditions and lack of access to rehabilitative education and tikanga Maori, they lit fires and, for 6 days, stayed on the roof, to bring attention to their demands to have their basic human rights returned to them. Rather than having the issues resolved, the “top jail” was destroyed in the fire and the prisoners were just sent to a different prison. All people, even criminals, deserve to be treated humanely and should not have to fight for basic human rights".

<h2> 2019 Kuranui Showquest </h2>
<h3> Placing: 1st place </h3>

"This year Kuranui’s theme was based on the historical dispute over Lake Wairarapa. Originally the lake had an abundant fish life which was important in providing kai to the many Māori who lived around it’s shores. Mid last century  a scheme to eliminate regular flooding and also establish more farm land saw the Ruamahanga river, which flowed through the lake, diverted. The local Māori lost a court battle to stop the scheme. Without fresh water running through the lake became stagnant and the once bountiful lake became lifeless".

"Nga wairua o te ope taua o te ao,
The spirits of the forgotten battalion,
Te mura o te ahi.
The flame of the fire.
"Our story is about a mother who endures her father’s experiences in the second world war as a soldier in the maori battalion. An emotional journey for both her and her son as she is reluctant to show him what war really is. We tell the tale but not glorifying war and paying tribute to those forgotten in the war, the Maori Battalion and those soldiers who lived out the war and had to live their lives without their comrades.
If we don’t tell their story… no one will...".

<h3> Placing: 3rd place </h3>
<p> The Wahine Disaster
On the 10th of April 1968, the passenger ferry ‘Wahine’ was caught in a fierce storm stirred by cyclone Giselle. The boat ran aground on the rocks of Barret Reef, at the entrance to Wellington Harbour, sustaining irreparable damage and causing the abandonment of the ship. Of the 734 people aboard, 51 died immediately; 2 more died weeks later due to sustained injuries. Through our performance we trace the tragedy through the eyes of a local family, re-telling a story that so many kiwis remember. <br>
